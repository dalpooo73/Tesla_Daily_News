            <h3>German newspaper encourages people to literally bet against Tesla (TSLA) in insane article</h3>
            <img src="images/1_image.jpg" alt="1_image">
            <p>
                German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine published a fairly crazy article in which it literally encouraged readers to bet against Tesla (TSLA) through a short position in order to bring Elon Musk “to his knees.”<br><br>

Tesla has had a long history with short sellers, which are people who take short positions on stock betting that it will go down.<br><br>

At times, Tesla’s stock was the most shorted stock on the Nasdaq with billions of dollars in bets against them.<br><br>

CEO Elon Musk loves taunting the short sellers – even sending one of them short shorts at some point and warning them that a “tsunami of pain” is coming for them if they hold their positions.<br><br>

He was right. Tesla’s stock has gained a lot in value over the last few years and the shorts have slowed down and reduced their position in Tesla.<br><br>

But economy columnist Daniel Mohr, who works for the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, wants to change that.<br><br>

He posted an article called “How to bet against Elon Musk” in which he encourages readers to bet with Tesla in one of the most dangerous ways: put warrants.<br><br>
